/*!
 Returns a new client instance for the described server. You should check the isValid property after initialization to ensure a connection was made to the server.
 @param description Typically acquired from the shared SyphonServerDirectory, or one of Syphon's notifications.
 @param device Metal device to create textures on.
 @param options Currently ignored. May be nil.
 @param handler A block which is invoked when a new frame becomes available. handler may be nil. This block may be invoked on a thread other than that on which the client was created.
 @returns A newly initialized SyphonMetalClient object, or nil if a client could not be created.

Returns a MTLTexture representing the current output from the server. The texture associated with the image may continue to update when you draw with it, but you should not depend on that behaviour: call this method every time you wish to access the current server frame. This object may have GPU resources associated with it and you should release it as soon as you are finished drawing with it.
